		<p class="adjust1">As the economy and education progressed, Seal Script emerged from Bronze Script, becoming more standardized and elongated in character form. Following the unification of China by Qin Shihuang, this script was further standardized across the nation, known as Small Seal Script. This refined script had fewer variations compared to earlier Oracle Bone and Bronze writings, adopting a distinct 'rhombus-shape' that laid the
			  groundwork for contemporary Chinese characters. The first dictionary of Chinese characters, compiled in the 3rd Century BCE, utilized this streamlined Small Seal Script.</p>
