		<p class="adjust1">Experts agree that the earliest known Chinese writing developed during the ancient Shang Dynasty. This form of writing was inscribed on animal bones and tortoise shells (known as oracle bone writing or "oracle
			script"). Oracle bones were used to divine subjects such as war, agricultural predictions, disease and death,and rituals. Some oracle bones contain as many as one hundred characters written in the form of questions. Scholars believe that at least 4,000 unique Chinese characters have been discovered, some of which
			form the basis of modern Chinese writing, and are therefore considered to be the oldest Chinese characters ever discovered.</p>
