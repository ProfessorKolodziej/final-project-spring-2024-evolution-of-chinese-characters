		<h2>Simplified Chinese Script (1956 to Present)</h2>
		<p class="SimplifiedChineseP">The history of Chinese writing wouldn’t be complete without looking at the introduction of the simplified system that is now in use in mainland China. There were calls to simplify the Chinese writing system from early in the 20th century with advocates claiming it was hampering China’s efforts to modernize and compete with other nations. The actual reform of the system didn’t take place until the 1950s, with the aim of increasing literacy rates. Simplified Chinese greatly reduced the number of strokes for each character, especially high usage words, making it much easier to learn to read and write, and easier to use in everyday life.</p>
