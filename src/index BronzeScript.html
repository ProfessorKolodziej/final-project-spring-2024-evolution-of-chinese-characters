		<h2>Bronze Script (1000 BCE to 200 BCE)</h2>
		<p class="BronzeP">Entering the Bronze Age, China was in the Zhou Dynasty. Archeology has found that people at that time began to cast characters on bronze vessels. Bronze Writing evolved from Oracle Bone Script. Over time the inscriptions tended to grow longer, with some from the late Zhou period up to 400 characters long. (The longest inscription, from the Western Zhou Dynasty period, has 497 characters). Characters also evolved to become less picture-like and more symbolic in appearance. However Bronze writing lacked uniformity and distinct regional variations emerged, as well as formal and informal styles. </p>
