		<h2>Regular Script (200CE to Present)</h2>
		<p class="RegularP">Regular Script came into being towards the end of the Han Dynasty, and was prominent during the Wei, Jin and Northern and Southern dynasties (220CE-589CE). The artistry of the Clerical script was often too complicated and therefore hard to read. As a result, the Regular Script style of writing was developed in order to be easier to read, and thus grew into the dominant position as the recognized structure of official characters. With some stylistic variations in the Tang Dynasty, the Regular script is the style still used in Traditional Chinese writing today in Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>
