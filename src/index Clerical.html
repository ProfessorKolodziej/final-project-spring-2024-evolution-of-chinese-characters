		<h2>Clerical Script (206 BCE to 220CE)</h2>
		<p class="ClericalP1">During Han dynasty. The Clerical script (sometimes also referred to as Official Script) became the dominant script. During the change from the Small Seal Script to the Clerical form of writing, the most profound modification was the symbolization of the characters, which no longer followed the previous method of directly representing material objects. </p>
		<p class="ClericalP2">Another important change was that the Clerical Script contains more straight lines within square dimensions. This was because the rounded shapes of the Seal Script style, though aesthetically pleasing to the eye, were difficult to write. Clerical script is still in use today, with some calligraphers using it as the script for their work. </p>
