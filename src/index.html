		<h1 class="bold">Evolution of Chinese Characters</h1>
        <p class="regular">Chinese characters are an ancient writing system dating back to initial symbols carved into pottery and bone 8,000 years ago. It evolved over thousands of years into a unified system 3,000 years ago, and has evolved further into its modern form. </p>
        <p class="regular">Unlike Western alphabets, Chinese characters are logographic, using symbols to represent words or phrases. The progression from primitive inscriptions to today's script reflects a complex development from ancient oracle bones script to today’s modern writing style.</p>
        <p>Chinese characters went through 6 stages of evolution: </p>
        <h3 class="bold">Oracle Bone Script, Bronze Script, Small Seal Script, Clerical Script, Regular Script, Simplified Chinese Script.</h3>
